# Go HTTP Demo
Using this to experiment with the GO HTTP library for personal projects and future projects.
## What it does
This currently connects to my API endpoint that jokedle uses for pulling the daily joke.
The joke is then written to a log file.  If there are errors, those are written to a seperate log file.
